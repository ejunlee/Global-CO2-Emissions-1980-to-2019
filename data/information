Main Dataset Structure:
Country - Country in question
Energy_type - Type of energy source
Year - Year the data was recorded
Energy_consumption - Amount of Consumption for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
Energy_production - Amount of Production for the specific energy source, measured (quad Btu)
GDP - Countries GDP at purchasing power parities, measured (Billion 2015$ PPP)
Population - Population of specific Country, measured (Mperson)
Energyintensityper_capita - Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of capita (capita = individual person), measured (MMBtu/person)
Energyintensityby_GDP- Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy. It is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP, measured (1000 Btu/2015$ GDP PPP)
CO2_emission - The amount of C02 emitted, measured (MMtonnes CO2)
